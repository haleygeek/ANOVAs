# ANOVAs
Scripts for running 1-Way and 2-Way (with or without repeated measures) ANOVAs

## Post-hoc analysis is performed with Tukey's Honest Significant Difference Test

## Means, standard deviation, and standard error were calculated for all groups and levels

## For two-way ANOVA with repeated measures
Treatment Group is a within-subjects factor
Intensity is the between-subjects factor (repeated measure)

## For one-way ANOVA
A kolmogorov-smirnov test was included to test the skewedness of the 
cumulative distribution
